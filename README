This is the firmware for my attiny44a-based interface board between the
BF20LV mill spindle motor board and a Centroid Acorn CNC controller.

My mill uses a three position forward-off-reverse reversing switch that
electrically swaps the polarity of the 220VDC drive from the motor
board.  The central off position ensures that the direction switching
does not occur while the drive is energised.

The Centroid Acorn offers canned spindle-forward and spindle-reverse
PLC outputs. To use these with the BF20LV spindle driver, these need
to be converted to an inhibit level signal and a start pulse signal to
the contactor, and a direction level signal to a DPDT relay to replace
the direction switch. Additionally, I don't want the direction relay
switching while the drive is active so I can use a cheap AC relay
instead of an expensive DC one.

The firmware does this signal conversion and also enforces 0VDC
direction switching by providing a spindown holdoff before the direction
can be reversed. It also looks for nonsensical input combinations
(especially forward+reverse simultaneously) and passes through a signal
to the mill head halogen light.

The attiny44a is pretty light on I/O, so the MCU status is communicated
via single letter morse code from a status LED. Read the code for what
the letters mean.
